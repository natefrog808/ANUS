## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating Web3 capabilities into the Anus AI framework. This integration will enable Anus AI agents to interact with blockchain networks, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other Web3 technologies, significantly expanding the framework's capabilities.

## Integration Components

### 1. Core Web3 Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `Web3ConnectionTool` | Manage connections to various blockchain networks | Implemented |
| `SmartContractTool` | Interact with smart contracts on different blockchains | Implemented |
| `TokenTool` | Handle token operations (balances, transfers, approvals) | Implemented |
| `NFTTool` | Manage NFT-related operations | Implemented |
| `DeFiTool` | Perform DeFi operations (swaps, lending, liquidity) | Implemented |
| `ENSTool` | Work with Ethereum Name Service | Implemented |
| `IPFSTool` | Handle IPFS operations | Implemented |

### 2. Specialized Web3 Agent

The `Web3Agent` specializes in blockchain interactions and provides:

- Simplified methods for common Web3 operations
- Proper error handling and data formatting for blockchain data
- Cross-chain compatibility
- Management of Web3 tool connections

### 3. Web3 Society

The `Web3Society` creates a multi-agent system with specialized roles:

- Blockchain Analyst
- Smart Contract Expert
- DeFi Specialist
- NFT Specialist
- Web3 Researcher

This society can tackle complex Web3 tasks through agent collaboration.

- ⬜ Build transaction monitoring system
- ⬜ Develop event listeners and webhooks

## Network Support

| Network | Status | Implementation Priority |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Ethereum | ✅ Implemented | High |
| Solana | ⬜ Planned | Medium |
| Polygon | ⬜ Planned | High |
| Arbitrum | ⬜ Planned | Medium |
| Optimism | ⬜ Planned | Medium |
| Base | ⬜ Planned | Medium |
| Avalanche | ⬜ Planned | Low |
| BNB Chain | ⬜ Planned | Low |

## Library Dependencies

The implementation relies on the following external libraries:

- `web3.py` - For Ethereum blockchain interactions
- `solana-py` - For Solana blockchain interactions
- `ipfshttpclient` - For IPFS operations
- `eth-brownie` - For smart contract development and testing
- `eth-ape` - For advanced contract interactions

## Configuration System

Users will configure their Web3 connections through the Anus AI configuration system:

```yaml
web3:
  providers:
    ethereum:
      mainnet: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
      goerli: "https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
    solana:
      mainnet: "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
      devnet: "https://api.devnet.solana.com"
  
  ipfs:
    gateway: "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/"
    
  wallet:
    default_address: "0xYourAddress"  # Optional, for read operations
```

## Security Considerations

### Private Key Management

- Private keys will never be stored in configuration files
- Keys will only be used for specific transaction signing
- Hardware wallet integration will be supported
- Options for using external signing methods will be provided

### Smart Contract Security

- Contract interactions will include optional simulation before execution
- Gas limits and price controls will be implemented
- Warning system for risky operations will be included

## CLI Extensions

The Anus CLI will be extended with Web3-specific commands:

```bash
# Check wallet balance
anus web3 balance --address 0xYourAddress

# Get token info
anus web3 token-info --address 0xTokenAddress

# Resolve ENS name
anus web3 ens --name vitalik.eth

# Interactive Web3 mode
anus web3 interactive
```

## Use Cases

### For Developers

1. Smart contract development and testing
2. Automated contract auditing
3. Event monitoring and notification
4. Multi-chain deployment

### For DeFi Users

1. Portfolio management and tracking
2. Yield optimization
3. Risk assessment
4. Strategy backtesting

### For Researchers

1. On-chain data analysis
2. Market intelligence
